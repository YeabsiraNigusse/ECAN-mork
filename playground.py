MORK_playground.py

A step-by-step playground showing 12+ MORK operations you can run against a local mork_server.

Prerequisites:
 - mork_server running and listening on http://127.0.0.1:8000
 - The Python `client.py` (your MORK client code) is in the same directory so we can `from client import MORK`.
 - A small CSV file named `test.csv` (sample content included below) in the same folder.

Sample `test.csv` contents (6 lines):
foo,1
foo,2
bar,1
bar,2
baz,3
baz,4

How to use:
 - Edit the `BASE_URL` if your server is not on 127.0.0.1:8000
 - Run this file with Python 3.10+: `python MORK_playground.py`
 - Each demo prints clear separators and the server responses; read the comments for explanations.

This is intentionally verbose so you can learn what each step does.
